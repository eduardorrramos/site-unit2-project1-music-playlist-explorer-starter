### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I truly believe that our labs were tailored perfectly to our weekly assignment; I found the linked videos to be especially helpful in working through specific methods expected of us. 
These alongside the live demos our instructors such as Paige Godfrey routinely held greatly impacted my ability to intake and retain this information.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I wish that this week had not been finals week at Northwestern as I attempted to balance studying for my finals at the same time as beginning to tackle CodePath's curriculum. This proved to be quite
a struggle, honestly, and if I had the time to allocate to CodePath I for sure would have done so. I hope to continue working on this assignment and fulfilling as many of the flex features as I can,
if not for CodePath then for my own learning as I have found HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be immensely rewarding to work with.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo will take place next week; however, I took note of several things I observed in other presentation and plan on implementing them throughout my own. I valued the ability of my peers to 
recognize their hardest struggles, as well as biggest achievements throughout their work. Attractive visuals as well as videos made these presentations not only englightening but enjoyable to watch as well.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Shout-out to Paige! She is the nicest person ever, really enjoyed working alongside her and loved our check-in. Could not have been better supported throughout this week, such a genuine person.
